## Artificial Intelligence Project Suite

This project provides a exploration of classical Artificial Intelligence methodologies, focusing on search algorithms, logic programming, and expert systems. The work is organized into three distinct modules:

* **State-Space Search:** A comparative implementation of various search strategies—including both informed and uninformed approaches—to identify optimal paths and solutions within defined state spaces.
* **Knowledge Representation and ASP:** Application of **Answer Set Programming (ASP)** for automated reasoning. This section demonstrates the power of declarative logic in modeling and solving complex constraint satisfaction tasks.
* **Rule-Based Adversarial Agents:** Design and implementation of an intelligent opponent for the board game **Othello**. The agent utilizes a rule-based architecture via the **CLIPS** (C Language Integrated Production System) environment, interfaced with Python through the `pyclips` library to bridge symbolic reasoning with procedural control.
